Physiological Factors Affecting Muscular Strength Muscular strength development is underpinned by a combination of several morphological and neural factors.  However, the mechanisms that improve muscular strength are considered multifactorial and can be influenced by other confounders such as initial strength [9], training status [10], and genetics [11].  The following provides a brief overview of the morphological and neural factors that may combine to affect muscular strength. Understanding these factors before discussing training considerations sets the context for the variety of responses in each of these underpinning factors that culminate to elicit muscular strength improvements.  Although a thorough discussion is beyond the scope of this review, it should be noted that an athlete’s history of muscle contraction (e.g. fatigue, post-activation, temperature, etc.) may influence the expression of muscular strength [12, 13].  3.1 Muscle Hypertrophy and Architecture Evidence indicates that residual effects from previous training phases carry-over into future training phases [14, 15]. Therefore, increasing hypertrophy in an effort to subsequently improve one’s strength has to do with potentiation and residual training effects [16-18]. Thus, it appears that there is a sequence or progression of training that, when followed, elicits the greatest benefits from RT.  Specifically, evidence suggests that an order of first increasing the muscle’s cross-sectional area (CSA) (i.e. hypertrophy) and work capacity (i.e. force production capacity) [17-19], followed by a subsequent phasic progression [20, 21], can produce superior strength-power gains.  Alterations in skeletal muscle hypertrophy can greatly impact a muscle’s ability to produce force and power.  Simple observation offers some evidence as to the importance of larger CSAs in creating greater absolute force production; indeed sports with body weight classes, such as powerlifting and weightlifting, support this observation.  The rationale behind this is that a greater muscle fiber CSA, particularly type II fibers, may alter the force-velocity characteristics of the whole muscle [16, 22].  Previous research indicated that strong relationships (r=0.70) existed between muscle CSA and greater force production [23].  Further literature suggested that muscle CSA increases and muscle architecture alterations may account for approximately 50-60% of the changes in force production following short-term RT [24], albeit with relatively untrained subjects.  Physiologically, muscle CSA increases may improve force production due to an increase in the number of cross-bridge interactions between actin and myosin within the previously- and newly-formed sarcomeres.  Kawakami et al. [25] indicated that muscle fiber pennation angles are greater in hypertrophied muscles than in normal muscles.  Larger pennation angles may increase the number of\n",

Despite some evidence to support the association between muscle hypertrophy and strength, it should be noted that changes in muscle size and strength can vary between individuals. Such variance between muscle hypertrophy and subsequent strength changes could be due to time-course differences between the measured adaptation, subsequent expression during the strength task, methodological issues associated with the determination of hypertrophy (e.g. physiological CSA vs. anatomical CSA; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measurements vs. girth measurements, etc.), or that enhanced strength can be affected by other physiological or neural factors beyond CSA [9].  In summary, increases in muscle CSA set a platform that combines with concomitant or subsequent changes in muscle architecture, fiber type, and other neural factors such as motor unit (MU) recruitment and muscle activation pattern to enhance the ability to increase maximum strength [17, 18, 26].  While a number of factors (e.g. muscle damage, metabolic alterations, tension, etc.) may affect the hypertrophic response, a thorough discussion of training methods is beyond the scope of this review.  For further information, readers are directed to a series of recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses that discuss best training practices for improving muscle hypertrophy [27-31].       3.2 Musculotendinous Stiffness Inherent to force production and the subsequent force expression as a measure of strength is the concept of our tissues expressing spring-like behavior which influences subsequent muscle performance [32].  Indeed, increased tissue stiffness (i.e. the relationship between a given force and the amount of stretch the tissue undergoes [33]) can enhance force transmission.  Therefore, tendon stiffness adaptations [34], as well as the structures within the muscle (e.g. actin, myosin, titin, and connective tissue), can influence muscular strength and associated characteristics such as rate of force development (RFD) [35, 36] and power [34, 37].  However, a commonly overlooked aspect of skeletal muscle force generation and expression of strength using the aforementioned measures is the role of the large protein or viscoelastic spring within the sarcomere, titin [38].  Titin could be responsible for generating passive tension in the sarcomere [39], which may be why recent evidence has suggested greater importance of the role of titin in muscle function [35, 39-41].  However, it should be noted that increased sarcoplasmic calcium may actively increase the stiffness of titin, contributing to the stiffness of the entire sarcomere [40].  Therefore, changes in muscular strength and force transmission may be partially influenced by changes in tissue stiffness within and surrounding the muscle.\n",
        "Training considerations for strength 6  3.3 Motor Unit Recruitment Henneman et al. [42] indicated that MUs are recruited in a sequenced manner based on their size (smallest to largest).  Thus, a pool of MUs will be recruited based on the magnitude of force and RFD required during a given task.  For example, smaller MUs that include slow-twitch type I fibers will be recruited when smaller force magnitudes and RFD are required, while larger MUs that include fast-twitch type IIa/IIx fibers may only be recruited if higher forces and RFD are required.  The recruitment order may be maintained during slow, graded, isometric [43], and ballistic actions [44, 45].  Although lower thresholds for MU recruitment may occur during ballistic-type movements due to the required RFD, the size principle appears to hold [36, 46].    The type and intent of the activity may directly affect which MUs are recruited and how they adapt [46-49].  For example, distance runners may only recruit low-threshold, slow-fatiguing MUs that contain type I fibers given the moderate forces that are required repeatedly during a race.  Due to the nature of the task, high-threshold MUs that contain type II fibers may only be recruited when MUs that contain type I fibers fatigue and additional force production is needed to sustain the activity.  Thus, while type I MUs may increase force production capability, the maximal strength expressed when using a combination of all MU types may still be relatively low in distance runners because of infrequent recruitment of MUs that contain type II fibers during training.  In contrast, weightlifters frequently perform ballistic tasks (e.g. snatch, clean and jerk, etc.) that require both high force and RFD magnitudes, and thus MUs that contain type II fibers are targeted.  Based on the recruitment order and lower recruitment thresholds, weightlifters likely recruit MUs that contain both type I and type II fibers, allowing both MU types to be trained.  Previous research demonstrated that while the orderly recruitment of MUs existed during both slow ramp and ballistic actions following ballistic-type training, MUs were recruited at lower force thresholds [46].  Regarding strength development, it appears to be beneficial to recruit high-threshold MUs during training.  Moreover, ballistic training methods may promote the recruitment of larger MUs that contain type II fibers at lower thresholds, thus raising the potential for positive strength-power adaptations to occur.    3.4 Rate Coding (Firing Frequency) After specific MUs are recruited, the frequency at which the α-motoneurons discharge action potentials to the MU’s muscle fibers can modify its force production properties.  Research indicated that force magnitude may increase\n",
        "Training considerations for strength 7  300-1500% when the firing frequency of recruited MUs increases from its minimum to its maximum [50].  Additional research indicated that RFD may be impacted by the firing frequency of MUs due to high initial firing frequencies being linked to increased doublet discharges (i.e. two consecutive MU discharges in ≤5ms interval) [46].  Thus, it may be postulated that the increased firing frequency of MUs that results in greater force magnitudes and RFD may aid strength-power development.  Previous research indicated that 12 weeks of ballistic training may enhance MU firing frequency [46].  Thus, it is possible that other ballistic training methods, such as weightlifting movements [51] and sprinting [52], may enhance MU firing frequency, ultimately benefitting strength-power characteristics.  3.5 Motor Unit Synchronization While some literature indicates that MU synchronization may be more related to RFD than to force production magnitude [53], it is possible that simultaneous activation of ≥2 MUs enhances peak force production by expressing greater RFD over short time periods.  Previous research indicated that six weeks of RT increased MU synchronization [54], while another study indicated that MU synchronization strength was larger in both the dominant and non-dominant hands of weightlifters compared to musicians and untrained individuals [55].  These findings are supported by research that suggested heavy RT may increase MU synchronization and force production [56].  While evidence strongly indicates that changes in muscular strength coincide with traditional RT, literature discussing MU synchronization changes following ballistic-type training is somewhat mixed.  One study noted that MU synchronization did not change following ballistic-type training [46], while other studies indicated that MU synchronization was enhanced during ballistic tasks [46, 57].  Practically speaking, it appears that training strategies that include heavy RT and/or ballistic-type movements may improve MU synchronization.  Although research examining changes in MU synchronization within RT literature associated with gross motor movements is limited, the link between improved neuromuscular activation patterns and subsequent force production cannot be discounted.   3.6 Neuromuscular Inhibition Neuromuscular inhibition refers to a reduction in the neural drive of a given muscle group during voluntary muscle actions that may negatively affect force production due to the neural feedback received from muscle and joint receptors [58].  While the previous neural mechanisms may produce positive strength-power adaptations, a neural\n",

Previous research indicated that heavy RT may down-regulate Ib afferent feedback to the spinal motoneuron pool, leading to reductions in neuromuscular inhibition and increased force production [56].  Further research reported an enhanced neural drive from both the spinal and supraspinal levels following RT that simultaneously decreased neuromuscular inhibition [59], increased power output via reciprocal inhibition during complex training [60], downregulated recurrent inhibition following explosive-type training [61], and enhanced RFD [62]. \"\"\""

            "Muscular strength development is influenced by various factors, including morphological, neural, initial strength, training status, and genetics. Let's explore some of these factors in detail.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Morphological Factors\n",
            "\n",
            "An athlete's past muscle state, such as fatigue, activation, and temperature, impacts their muscular strength. Additionally, previous training phases can affect muscle hypertrophy and architecture.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Cross-Sectional Area (CSA)\n",
            "\n",
            "Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) correlates strongly with increased force production, especially for type II fibers. Up to 50-60% of force production enhancements following short-term resistance training can be attributed to muscle CSA growth and architecture modifications.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Tissue Stiffness\n",
            "\n",
            "Tissue stiffness enhances force transmission, influencing muscular strength through tendon stiffness adaptations and muscle structure modifications. This affects RFD and power.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Neural Factors\n",
            "\n",
            "Neural factors play a crucial role in muscular strength. These include motor unit (MU) recruitment and muscle activation patterns.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Motor Unit (MU) Recruitment\n",
            "\n",
            "Motor unit (MU) recruitment follows a size sequence, dependent on force and RFD demand. A pool of MU sizes is selected based on force and RFD needs for tasks. Smaller MUs with slow-twitch type I fibers are used for smaller force magnitudes and RFD, while larger MUs with fast-twitch type IIa/IIx fibers are employed for greater forces and RFD.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Motor Unit (MU) Firing Frequency\n",
            "\n",
            "Post-recruitment, α-motoneuron firing frequency impacts MU muscle fiber force production. Studies suggest enhanced force magnitude when two quick MU discharges occur within 5ms.\n",

            "#### Exercise 1: Heavy Resistance Training\n",
            "\n",
            "Heavy resistance training enhances muscle unit (MU) synchronization and force production. Traditional resistance training correlates with muscular strength changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Exercise 2: Ballistic Training\n",
            "\n",
            "Ballistic training techniques can encourage activation of larger MUs with type II fibers at lower thresholds, potentially leading to strength-power improvements.\n",
