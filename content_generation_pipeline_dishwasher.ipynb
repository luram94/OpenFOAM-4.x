        "actually powering most predictive programs – including spam filters, product recommenders,\n",
        "and fraud detectors — are machine learning algorithms.\n",
        "Data scientists are expected to be familiar with the differences between supervised machine\n",
        "learning and unsupervised machine learning — as well as ensemble modeling, which uses a\n",
        "combination of approaches techniques, and semi-supervised learning, which combines\n",
        "supervised and unsupervised approaches.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Supervised Learning (SL): In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each input example comes with an associated output or target label. The goal of the model is to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs based on this labeled data. Once trained, the model can then be used to predict the output for new, unseen input data. Commonly used algorithms for supervised learning include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.\n",
            "2. Unsupervised Learning (UL): In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, which means that there are no target labels provided for the input examples. Instead, the goal of the model is to find patterns or structure in the data without any explicit guidance. Commonly used algorithms for unsupervised learning include clustering algorithms like K-means and hierarchical clustering, dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), and association rule mining.\n",
            "3. Ensemble Learning (EM): Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique where multiple models are combined to improve the overall performance of the system. This is typically done by training several base models on different subsets of the data or using different algorithms, and then combining their predictions to make a final prediction. The idea behind ensemble learning is that by combining the strengths of multiple models, the resulting ensemble can achieve better accuracy and robustness than any individual model. Commonly used ensemble methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking.\n",
            "4. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSM): In semi-supervised learning, the model is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. The goal is to leverage the large amount of unlabeled data to help the model learn more effectively from the limited amount of labeled data. This is often achieved by using the unlabeled data to learn some underlying structure or distribution in the data, which can then be used to help the model make more accurate predictions on the labeled data. Commonly used algorithms for semi-supervised learning include self-training, multi-view training, and co-training.\n"
